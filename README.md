Welcome![Discover Barbados](https://crosshorns.github.io/MS1-Discover-Barbados)

# Introduction
This website is created for travel entusiasts who like to explore beautiful new destinations and things to do. Quite often it just so happens that the best travelling and vacationing experiences are found out of the gaze of the popular media channels. Sometimes this is a good thing because it means there is no crowding out of the nicer spots! To start with we have kept things very simple with this website; we will introduce you to a couple of interesting places to see in Barbados and a couple of great places to dine; The information will appear on the contents page of this website and every so often we will add to the list.

A live website can be found [here] (https://crosshorns.github.io/MS1-Discover-Barbados)

1. ## User Experience **(UX) design

The website has been designed as a place on the internet to be of interest to travel enthusiasts and holidaymakers who would be interested in finding low-cost and relatively unknown places of interest within Barbados.

1.1 ## User Goals

The main goal of this website is to provide useful information of places of interest and relatively low cost within Barbados to interested parties within the global travelling and vacationing communities.

1.2 ## User Expectations

The website provides knowledge regarding certain places of interest and places to eat in Barbados for those who may not have been before or those who may be seekeing a low cost or novel alternative on the island.

The following user expectations were considered while designing the site:
-The website structure was designed to be responsive for all screen and device sizes, including desktop computer screens, tablets and mobile telephones.
-The user interface is straightforward to use and includes a navigation bar which collapses to e smaller as the size of the screen, device or 'phone decreases.
-The website is, on the whole, easy to use, with simple navigation between the three pages, Home, Tourist Info and Contact Us; most useful information for the users can be found on the Tourist Info page, including high resolution images of places of interest. 

1.3 ## Colour Scheme

Initially, the colour scheme used was intended to blend in with the flag and identity of Barbados; a bold yellow and deep blue, which in turn blend in with its famously sunny weather and blue seas. However, after some consideration of accessibility, I settled on the view that a brilliant white (#ffffff) would blend nicely with the blue navigation bar for accesibility. The blue and white also blend in well with the images on the website.

1.4 Site Skeleton

The websites wireframes were created using Balsamiq software, in order to create UI designs with templates. The original wireframes for this project were designed for mobile browsers and web browsers.

4. ## Testing

W3C Validator Tools

Initially errors were notified on the HTML Mark up tests, but these were cleared and then on subsequently running the test, no eerors were found.

A test was also run for CSS, and no errors were found.

Google Developer Tools

Manual Testing

The website was tested on the following laptops, devices and 'phones:
Apple Macbook Pro
Apple Iphone 11
Samsung
Ipad

An independent party tested the website for navigation through its pages, responsiveness and accessibility on each device, and that party was more than satisfied that the website had passed each of these tests on each device.

6. ## Deployment

The website was deployed to GitHub Pages by the following actions:
I created a Github account. I then created a new repository in Github. I then clicked on settings, and selected Pages on the left menu bar. A live website link was then produced.
