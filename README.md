# Introduction
This website is created for travel entusiasts who like to explore beautiful new destinations and things to do. Quite often it just so happens that the best travelling and vacationing experiences are found out of the gaze of the popular media channels. Sometimes this is a good thing because it means there is no crowding out of the nicer spots! To start with we have kept things very simple with this website; we will introduce you to a couple of interesting places to see in Barbados and a couple of great places to dine; The information will appear on the contents page of this website and every so often we will add to the list.
