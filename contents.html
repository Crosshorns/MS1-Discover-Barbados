    <p style="font: size 2px;vw;">Harrison's Cave is an extremely old tourist attraction on the island of Barbados which may not be on the radar of 21st century travellers and holidaymakers, but has been in existence since 1795. A novel aspect of the attraction is that visitors access the cave by tramway. The cave is located in the central uplands of Barbados at 210 metres above sea level. It is naturally formed by water erosion through the limestone rock. The water which has run through the cave has formed stalactites and stalagmites.
A variety of tours are offered daily, from 8.45am to 3.45pm.
the price for an hour long tram is 60 Barbadian dollars for each adult and 30 Barbadian dollars for children.
The address is Allen View, Barbados.

Sunbury Plantation House is over 300 years old, steeped in history, featuring mahogany antiques, old prints and a unique collection of horse-drawn carriages.
