    <h2 class="my-5 white">About Discover Barbados</h2> 
    
    <img src="" class="rounded float-right" width="222" height="182" alt="Miami Beach Barbados">

    <p>This website is created for travel entusiasts who like to explore beautiful new destinations and things to do. Quite often it just so happens that the best travelling and vacationing experiences are found out of the gaze of the popular media channels. Sometimes this is a good thing because it means there is no crowding out of the nicer spots! To start with we have kept things very simple with this website; we will introduce you to a couple of interesting places to see in Barbados and a couple of great places to dine; The information will appear on the contents page of this website and every so often we will add to the list.</p>

<h3 class="my-5 yellow">Why Barbados?</h3>
<p>The reason why Barbados has been chosen as the focus of this website is because many travellers and holidaymakers who have never been there may not think it is an affordable place to visit; however, they are missing out on paradise. Did you know that Barbados has substantially increased its tourism offering and prior to the pandemic recorded three consecutive years of growth in tourist arrivals with over 680,000 visiting in 2018. Barbados is well known for its fantastic beaches, blue skies and warm weather, but did you also know that it is the birthplace of international pop idol Rihanna and Test match cricketer Sir Gary Sobers? The atlantic coast of the island at Bathsheba is excellent for world class surfing and is often used for world surfing championships.</p>

  <h4 class="my-5 yellow">How are our recommendations different?</h4>
  <img src="PHOTO-2021-09-13-02-13-16.jpg" class=" rounded float-right" width="222" height="182" alt="country">
  <p>Our recommendations are different to other similar websites, because we show travellers and holidaymakers little-known and cost effective places to visit. These idylls and hideaway gems are off the well-worn commercial holidaymaker's track, and are only really known about by regular travellers to Barbados who make the extra effort to explore and delve into the relatively unkknown. Such places are not often amon the highlights of holiday brochures or packages, but still warrant a good look and are worth the time invested. Please take a look around the website; we're hoping our recommendations will turn into must-see spots for the curious traveller and adventurous vacationer alike. Once you begin to visit these spots, Barbados will feel like a home away from home to you!</p>
